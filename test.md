This is a test of creating markdown pages.

Imagine this is a paragraph, and I want to include a full-width image beneath it...

<div class="wide">
  <div class="wide-img-container">
    <img class="wide-img" src="/assets/img/checkmate-small.jpg" />
  </div>
</div>

Let's see if that works!

Given a vector
$$
  \vec{n} =
  \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      n_{x} \\
      n_{y} \\
      n_{z} \\
    \end{array}
  \right]_{\beta}
$$
where $$x$$, $$y$$ and $$z$$ are...

``` cpp
#include <iostream>

int someNum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
  someNum += i;
}

std::cout << someNum;
```
